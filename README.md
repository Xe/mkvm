# waifud

A few tools to help me manage and run virtual machines across a homelab cluster.

waifud was made for my own personal use and I do not expect it to be very useful
outside that context. 

<big>THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL! USE IT AT YOUR OWN PERIL!</big>

TODO(Xe): Link to blogpost on the design/implementation once it is a thing.
